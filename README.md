# Maze-Generator

This is a maze generator made using the depth-first and backtracking algorithms.<br/>
I made this using the p5.js library.<br/>
These are few of the snaps of the maze getting created.<br/>
You need to run this over a server so as to load it .<br/>
You can use an extension "live server" in vs code to run it.<br/> 
Or you can see it here https://manwindersingh1712.github.io/Maze-Generator/ <br/>
